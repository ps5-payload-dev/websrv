# ps5-payload-websrv
This is a simple web server that can be executed on a Playstation 5 that has
been jailbroken via the [BD-J][bdj] or the [webkit][webkit] entry points.
It can be used to launch homebrew via the Webkit browser embedded with the PS5,
or remotely from your PC, phone, etc.

## Quick-start
To deploy ps5-payload-websrv, first make sure [ps5-payload-elfldr][elfldr] is
running, then load the payload as follows:

```console
john@localhost:~$ export PS5_HOST=ps5
john@localhost:~$ wget -q -O - https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/websrv/releases/download/v0.12/Payload.zip | gunzip -c -d | nc -q0 $PS5_HOST 9021
```

To interact with ps5-payload-websrv, either install the [Launcher PKG][launcher]
on your PS5, or point your browser to one of the available services exemplified
below.

## Available services
Examples:
- http://ps5:8080/index.html - Launch Homebrew
- http://ps5:8080/elfldr - Launch ELF Payloads
- http://ps5:8080/fs/ - Browser the filesystem (html)
- http://ps5:8080/fs/?fmt=json - Browser the filesystem (json)
- http://ps5:8080/fs/system_ex/app/NPXS40028/redis.conf - Download a file

## Installing Homebrew
The web server will search for homebrew in /data/homebrew, and makes a couple
of assumtions on the filestructure. More specifically, suppose you have a
homebrew called MyHomebrew, the loader assumes that the following files exist:
- /data/homebrew/MyHomebrew/eboot.elf - Payload to run, compiled with [ps5-payload-sdk][sdk].
- /data/homebrew/MyHomebrew/sce_sys/icon0.png - An icon to be rendered at /index.html.

You can also add your own custom UI extentions by specifying a javascript file named:
- /data/homebrew/MyHomebrew/homebrew.js

This is useful when the payload accepts different command line options, e.g.,
an emulator that expects arguments for loading roms. For an example on
available capabillitiles, see:
- https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/websrv/tree/master/homebrew/demo

For real-world homebrew, checkout the latest release at:
- https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/websrv/releases

## Building
Assuming you have the [ps5-payload-sdk][sdk] installed on a Debian-flavored
operating system, the payload can be compiled using the following commands:
```console
john@localhost:ps5-payload-dev/websrv$ export PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK=/opt/ps5-payload-sdk
john@localhost:ps5-payload-dev/websrv$ ./libmicrohttpd.sh # build and install libmicrohttpd to $PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK
john@localhost:ps5-payload-dev/websrv$ make
```

## Known Issues
- Homebrew sometimes crashes when there is already a previous homebrew running.
- The kernel can panic if you go into restmode and back again while a homebrew is running.
